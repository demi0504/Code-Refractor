# Code-Refractor
## Description
For this project my goal was to examine and make changes to an exsisting HTML file in order to improve its readability and accessibility. I've removed the `<div>` tags and replaced them with semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<footer>` and `<section>`. 
In the original HTML the `<img>` tags did not include any alt attributes, so I have added descriptive alt attributes for accessibility. The main goal here was to leave the exsisting code better than I found it, so I've added the necessary elements to do so.
